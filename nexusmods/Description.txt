[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
Current version of the mod uses a main key and modifiers key around it to trigger different functionalities.
The default main Hotkey is [b]Q[/b], move the mouse cursor on an item in the inventory then press Q to pick up exactly 1 item from the stack.
Modifier key to pick up half of the stack is [b]Shift[/b]. Press [b]Shift + Q[/b] to pick up half of items stack. 
Both keys can be used multiple times to increase the amount of items you're about to take from the stack.
Additionally there are two modifiers to increase or decrease the stack:
[b]Ctrl + Q[/b] will increase the stack of highlighted item, [b]Alt + Q[/b] will decrease it. (cheat option)
With v1.1.0 new cheat functions were added:
Double Stack [b]Ctrl + Shift + Q[/b], will double item's current stack.
Halve Stack [b]Alt + Shift + Q[/b], will halve item's current stack.
All keys, modifiers and the cheat mode can be changed in the file [i]main.lua[/i] . (see Configuration section below)
[size=3]All cheat options work only as host![/size]

[size=3]The key [b]Q[/b] is bound to "Store all of type" in game own settings per default![/size]
I recommend to change it in game Settings->Controls to something else, [b]R[/b] might be a good option, since you don't reload while in inventory anyway.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. You need the [b]UE4SS_v{version number}.zip [/b] (e.g.  UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] ![/size]
[size=2]For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/font]
The mod is NOT compatible with the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/6]Just Press Q[/url] mod!

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
[list]
[*]Random crashes when pressing the hotkey. (Sadly I think it's a problem with UE4SS, it happens quite rarely but still can happen)
[*]Current UE4SS version works with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
