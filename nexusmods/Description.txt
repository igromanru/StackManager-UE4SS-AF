[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
Current version of the mod uses a main key and modifiers key around it to trigger different functionalities.
The default main Hotkey is [b]Q[/b], move the mouse cursor on an item in the inventory then press Q to pick up exactly 1 item from the stack.
Modifier key to pick up half of the stack is [b]Shift[/b]. Press [b]Shift + Q[/b] to pick up half of items stack. 
Both keys can be used multiple times to increase the amount of items you're about to take from the stack.
Additionally there are two modifiers to increase or decrease the stack:
[b]Ctrl + Q[/b] will increase the stack of highlighted item, [b]Alt + Q[/b] will decrease it. (cheat option)
[b]Cheat Mode:[/b] Setting that is default disabled. It causes Q (take 1 item) to increase the stack of the highlighted item if there are not enough items in the stack to be taken.
The main key, modifiers and the cheat mode can be changed in the file [i]main.lua[/i] . (see Configuration section below)
[size=3]All cheat options work only as host![/size]

[size=3]The key [b]Q[/b] is bound to "Store all of type" in game own settings per default![/size]
I recommend to change it in game Settings->Controls to something else, [b]R[/b] might be a good option, since you don't reload while in inventory anyway.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Feedback[/b][/size][/font]
I've released the mod as soon I was done testing all the features.
Please report any issues and ideas.
Also If you really need each feature of the mod as a different key, please let me know.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
